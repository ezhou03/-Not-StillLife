I wanted to explore how little movements within a "Still life" scene can bring said scene--filled with inanimate objects--to life. I used common still life objects such as the skull and the candle, and incorporated little pieces of movement to each of them with the mouseX and mouseY variables. Although I did not fully accomplish what I set out to do , which was to make the skull 'rotate' through optical illusion, I still think the scene turned out nicely.
